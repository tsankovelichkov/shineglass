                        <p className="mt-4 mt-lg-0">Sunglasses are a fashionable accessory of a very special kind. Needless to say, they must protect our eyes reliably against glare and harmful UV radiation. But they must also be fun to wear. They reflect your personal style and personality – and not just when the sun is shining!

Many people don't know just how functional and customised sunglasses – and the lenses in particular – can really be these days. Dive into the world of ShineGlass sunglasses and discover what sunglass type you are, what functions your individualised sunglasses need and what sort of sunglass lenses are right for you: polarising, self-tinting or for lenses featuring precisely the customised tint you want. Take your pick!</p>
